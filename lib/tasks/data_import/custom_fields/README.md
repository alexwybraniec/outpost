# üíø Custom fields

There are two files included in this repository, [custom-fields-template--with-sample-data.csv](./custom-fields-template--with-sample-data.csv) and [custom-fields-template.csv](./custom-fields-template.csv). These files will allow you to run an initial import of your data to Outpost. 

The screenshot below gives a visual example of what your file might look like
![custom-fields-sample-data.png](./custom-fields-sample-data.png)

* Each row in the document must have a unique numeric ID `import_id`. If this ID is missing the import script will not run.
* The `import_id_reference` field refers to the section that custom field belongs to.
* Each field requires a section.
* `name` - If there are duplicate custom field section names - the script will **continue** and assign all fields to the existing section
* `name` - If there are duplicate custom field names, even under other sections - the script will output an error but continue with import

## Select options


A full list of options will always be available in the [custom_field model](https://github.com/wearefuturegov/outpost/blob/master/app/models/custom_field.rb#L6). 


Currently the accepted field types are:

```
Text
Number
Checkbox
Select
Date
```


# Running the import

You can run the task with:

```
rake import:custom_fields
```

By default, the rake task will look for a file called `custom-fields.csv` in the
`lib/seeds` folder.

You can also import data from a different file location on your file system, by
passing a file path in to the rake task. This is an optional argument.

To do this, replace `<file_path>` with the location of the file you
wish to import data from (make sure to keep the quote marks around the task name):

```
rake 'import:custom_fields[<file_path>]'
```
